    <p><strong>Get emotional about your Product Fashion Description Copy.</strong>  Another reason why product fashion descriptions are ignored by retailers is that there is no human touch involved in an e-commerce transaction. But customers want an emotional connection. They want to be able to connect with the product, brand, and what's behind the promise. Imagine yourself standing in a physical store at a shopping mall, pitching your products to a customer who has just walked into the showroom. When you're in direct contact with your customer, the stakes become higher, you're more attentive and your margin for error becomes smaller because you not only fear sounding indifferent, ignorant, and lazy but also you want to see the customer walking out of the door with shopping bags full of your products. You will not let them wander around in the showroom hoping they would buy. Whereas in an e-commerce situation, retailers tend to play the number game - show a product to 100 visitors, one will buy.</p>
